How to use Beefy
First, install node.js (this also installs NPM). Now you can install beefy and browserify:

npm install beefy browserify -g
The -g means you are installing both modules as global modules, which means you can use them directly from the command line. There is also a way to just bundle beefy along with your node module.

Now make a file called foo.js that has some code in it that uses require() statements to load node modules, like this:

var url = require('url')
document.body.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(url.parse(window.location.href))
Now start beefy:

beefy foo.js
This starts the beefy server on the default port of 9966. Open up localhost:9966 to see the code from foo.js running in your browser!
