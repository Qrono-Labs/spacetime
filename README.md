## [Get Threadhelper in the Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threadhelper/nfadnflafdfmekapgcgddbccooagpndk) | [Our Vision](https://www.notion.so/Dao-of-ThreadHelper-8eb909d560d747f28e8b285525a60726)

A serendipity engine on the Twitter sidebar.

ThreadHelper is the Twitter extension that finds the tweets you need.

ThreadHelper augments your Twitter experience by ambiently, automatically and instantly, finding the tweets you need.

How?

### 🌟 Instantaneous Full-text Search

ThreadHelper substitutes Twitter stock search bar with its own interface and search algorithm. As you type a new tweet it will, automatically and instantly, comb through yout tweets to find the ones most relevant to what you want to talk about at the moment, and present them to you on the sidebar widget.

### ⚙️ Full search customization

The algorithm is fully controlled by you. It can search over any combination of your past tweets, retweets, bookmarks, and replies. Maybe you’d like to include the tweets of your alts in those searches. Or maybe not. That’s also under your control.

### 🎮 Complete Control

Interact with sidebar tweets like with any other: reply, retweet, quote-tweet, and like, all directly from the side bar. You can copy and paste their url onto the tweet you’re currently composing to quote-tweet it, all without ever having to open a new tab.

### 💎 Search directly from the sidebar

ThreadHelper makes it that never need to open a new Twitter tab again, making your experience smoother than ever before. ThreadHelper shines when you don’t even know which tweet you need and it manages to find exactly that one.

However, sometimes, you do know what tweet you’re looking for. For those times you can search the whole of Twitter, directly from the ThreadHelper sidebar. You can interact with those search results the way you can interact with any tweet, never having to open a new tab, and never having to leave the page you’re on.

### ⌨️ Search commands

Because ThreadHelpers search bar results come from Twitter’s API, you can use all Twitter API search commands, directly on the sidebar, just as you could if you were using Twitter’s native search.

### 🛳 Smoother experience

If you open a tweet, TH will show you all of its quote tweets, sorted by popularity. This way you don’t need to navigate away.

### 🎯 Contextual navigation

Twitter can be a bit of a maze sometimes. To help with that, whenever you open a tweet, ThreadHelper automatically searches and presents tweets that are related to the one you’re seeing at the moment, allowing you to better contextualize it, avoiding context collapse.

### 👾 Serendipity engine

Sometimes the timeline is boring and you just wanna see new stuff. ThreadHelper has a ‘shuffle tweets’ toggle which, if selected, will make it so that by default ThreadHelper shows you a random selection of tweets. This way you can have two timelines for the space of one. (You can also set it off so that it doesn’t do that, if you find one timeline to be more than enough.)

### Your data, safe 🕵️‍♀️

All ThreadHelper does is run searches in your browser. It never uploads any of your information anywhere besides Twitter. As the creators of this extension, we never see or receive any of your data. ThreadHelper also prompts you to download an archive of your data on your local machine, so that the data you’ve produced on Twitter stays yours forever.
