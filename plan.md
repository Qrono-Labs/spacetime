Mindset: Curiosity of boundary violation - Can I do this? Where or when will I be stopped? By what or whom, and how?

Vibe: ‘So crazy it might just work’

DO NOT lose the thread: people want the maze - the experience of it, exploring their own minds outside themselves

Plan steps:

1. Better threading (automatic)
2. Above and marketed for thread (“visa-as-a-service”)
3. above but marketed as cognitive technology (dynamic knowledge repository but feels like playing mmorpg
4. above but forks sold to enterprises substituting slack/email/internal knowledge bases
5. above but fully public decentralised that lives forever (decentralised twitter / wikipedia mmorpg - doing my knowledge market inefficiency seeking alpha but at scale for everyone forever, online)

External milestones:

1. Beat Twitter Search solution
2. Beat Twitter Threading solution
3. Beat Roam
4. Beat slack/email/internal knowledge databases
5. Achieve >>> Salesforce size

Selling point at each stage:

- Way nicer, visually; easier to use; results more relevant

- Notes apps all use wrong metaphor by importing real-world to online. You must do it from first principles, online first, not impose real-world analog legibility.

- Email sucks and everyone hates it lol. Cummings said that increasing intellect and solving hardest policy problems are the same problem or benefit from the same one solution. This is the solution for group cognition. This is what email and slack and knowledge databases try to solve but they don’t know it so, again, they don’t do it from first principles and so fail to.
- Massive multiplayer online tool for thought. Era defining meta-pattern. New beginning. Knowledge is more than the sums of its parts but the part you need is in someone else’s mind.
